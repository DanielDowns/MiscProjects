README for the NaturalSelectionSim

This is a multithreaded Java application simulating a number of 
carnivorous and herbivorous Critters in a small environment. The creatures
will attempt to eat whatever they can and reproduce.

If you'd like to see the code in action, there are two YouTube videos you can view here:
Random Simulation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W-ZO2t3xLU
Custom Simulation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQm2kGNtgqQ

If you want to download and play with it yourself, you will need to point the code
looking for the sprite ("omnicrit.png", used for Critters and Food and the 8 directional
sprites "Ncrit.png", "Wcrit.png", "NWcrit.png", etc) to where it is on your
computer
